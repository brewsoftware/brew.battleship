# BATTLESHIP State Machine

##  Background
This is an implementation of a Battleship state-tracker for a single player that must support the
following logic:
* Create a board
* Add a battleship to the board
* Take an “attack” at a given position, and report back whether the attack resulted in a
hit or a miss.
* Return whether the player has lost the game yet (i.e. all battleships are sunk)
The application implements just the state tracker.

## Getting Started
Ensure you have the following pre-requisites
* .Net Core 3.0

## Testing
To run tests use the commad `dotnet test`
